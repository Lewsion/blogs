# What is a PBX?

A PBX, which stands for Private Branch Exchange, serves as an internal telephone network within a company or organization. It's like a private phone system for a business, allowing employees to make calls to each other using internal extensions.

**Key Functions:**
- **Call Routing:** When someone calls the company, the PBX routes the call to the right extension or department. It's like a virtual receptionist directing calls.
- **Outbound Calls:** For outgoing calls, the PBX connects employees to the outside telephone network, so they can call external numbers.

**Additional Features:**
- **Call Forwarding:** PBX systems can forward calls to another number or extension. For example, if someone is on vacation, their calls can be redirected to a colleague.
- **Voicemail:** PBX systems manage voicemail, allowing employees to receive and retrieve messages left by callers.

**Components:**
PBX systems use a mix of hardware and software. Hardware includes telephones, switches, and sometimes servers. These work together to route calls and provide features like voicemail.

In essence, a PBX is the heart of a company's phone system, managing both internal and external calls and providing various features to improve communication within the organization.
