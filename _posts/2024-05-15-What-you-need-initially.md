### Getting Started with Lewsion Technologies: What You Need Initially

When beginning your journey with Lewsion Technologies, there are a few key items you'll need to ensure a smooth and successful experience. Here's a guide to help you get started:

#### 1. IP Number
- At the initial stage, clients are required to have an IP number. However, Lewsion Technologies does not provide IP numbers directly. Instead, we have established partnerships with reputable IPTSPs. Through these partnerships, we procure and manage all necessary formalities on behalf of our clients, ensuring a seamless and efficient process. Otherwise, if you already own an IP number, we can easily setup your system with that existing number by transfering that IP number from your recent PBX provider.

#### 2. Required Documents
- BTRC Number Registration Application (This will be provided by Lewsion Technologies)
- National ID Card of Client
- Passport Size Picture (1 Copy)
- Trade License of Client's Business

#### 3. IP Phone
- Choosing an IP phone is a wise decision. We offer a selection of specific IP phone models. The suggested IP phone models are: (This will be provided by Lewsion Technologies).

#### 4. Softphone
- For softphones, we recommend Ringotel (Desktop, Mobile Phone) and Zoiper (Desktop & Mobile Phone). While other softphones are compatible, Lewsion Technologies provides support only for Ringotel and Zoiper. Clients can choose from the following softphones:
   1. Zoiper with Push Proxy
   2. Groundwire (Paid)
   3. Linphone
   4. jiPBX
   5. Bria

#### 5. PBX Server
- While clients have the option to purchase their own server and set up their PBX, this process can be complex and burdensome. At Lewsion Technologies, we offer a hassle-free and user-friendly PBX solution, LewsionPBX.If you are purchasing LewsionPBX, you need not to worry about a PBX. Lewsion Technologies will handle all the hassle, while you enjoy a smooth & top-notch communication system.
